# Engage-FaceRecognisition

Url for deployed web application on heuroko : "https://faceanalysis-enagage22.herokuapp.com/"

Steps to run the web application on the local machine :

Install all the requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt also the runserver extension

1. Clone the github repository into a folder.
2. Open the folder in vs code 
3. open the terminal and run the command  "py manage.py runserver" 
4. open this link in your web browser http://127.0.0.1:8000/
5. now you can upload the image and can get the results

Note : A face is recognised only if face detection score is greatear than 0.7 and identified only if face score is greater than 0.44. I had kept these constraints for better results. So uploading the good quality images is suggested for better results.

I had uploaded the webpage screenshots in the ScreenShots folder in repository.
In the Testing Pictures Folder You can see some sample pictures used for testing the webapp
